# ir

`ir` runs standalone R scripts that declare their own runtime requirements in
the script itself. It resolves those requirements into cached, isolated package
libraries and runs the script against them.

```r
#!/usr/bin/env -S ir run
#| dependencies:
#|   - dplyr>=1.0
#|   - tidyr
#| r-version: ">= 4.0"
#| exclude-newer: "2024-01-15"

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

1 + 1
```

```console
$ ir run script.R
$ ir run --vanilla script.R
# or, if the script is executable:
$ ./script.R
```

It can also evaluate inline expressions, pull in extra dependencies from the
command line, and run package-shipped executables from `exec/`:

```console
$ ir run -e '1 + 1'                          # inline expression, isolated library
$ ir run --with cli -e 'cli::cli_alert_success("hi")'
$ ir run --with dplyr,tidyr script.R         # add to the script's own deps
$ ir run --r-version 4.5 script.R            # select R with rig
$ ir tool run --from btw btw --help          # run exec/btw from package btw
$ ir tool run btw --help                     # shorthand for --from btw btw
$ ir tool run --from github::r-lib/Rapp Rapp
$ ir tool install btw                        # install launchers for exec/* apps
$ ir tool install github::r-lib/Rapp
```

For `ir tool run --from pkg tool`, `ir` resolves `pkg`, finds `exec/tool` or
`exec/tool.R` in the installed package, and launches that file with the selected
Rscript. The package ref can be a pak package ref or supported version spec. Use
quotes when the shell would otherwise interpret characters such as `>`.

For `ir tool install pkg-ref`, `ir` resolves `pkg-ref`, scans that package's
`exec/` directory for files whose shebang names `Rscript` or `Rapp`, and writes
launchers into `IR_TOOL_BIN_DIR`, `RAPP_BIN_DIR`, `XDG_BIN_HOME`,
`XDG_DATA_HOME/../bin`, or `~/.local/bin` on Unix. Use `--bin-dir <dir>` for an
explicit destination and `--force` to overwrite existing launcher paths. The
launchers pin `R_LIBS` to the resolved `ir` cache library and set
`R_LIBS_USER=NULL`; if `ir cache clean` removes that library, rerun
`ir tool install --force pkg-ref`.

## How it works

`ir run` and `ir tool run` run in two phases:

1. **Resolve + materialise** (a private, throw-away R session).
   - The YAML frontmatter is parsed by Rust with **saphyr**.
   - If the YAML frontmatter has `r-version: "VERSION-SPEC"` or `ir run` is
     called with `--r-version VERSION-SPEC`, the requested R version is selected
     from installed versions reported by `rig list --json`. If no installed R
     satisfies the request, `ir` selects the newest available matching R version
     to suggest a concrete `rig install` command. With `exclude-newer`, dates
     covered by the embedded available-version table do not parse JSON, consult
     the filesystem, or call `rig available`; newer dates use a cached
     `<cache>/rig/available.json`, fetching it with `rig available --json` only
     when the cache is absent.
   - A *resolution cache* short-circuits this whole phase: the declared
     dependencies plus the resolution source (and R version / platform) are
     hashed, and if that exact request was already resolved, its library is
     reused and **pak is not invoked at all**. Latest resolution folds the
     current date into the key, forcing a fresh resolution — picking up newly
     published versions — at most once a day. Dated Posit Package Manager
     snapshot resolution uses the snapshot date instead.
   - On a cache miss, the declared dependencies are resolved into concrete
     package versions with **pak** (`pak::pkg_deps`), including the full
     transitive closure.
   - If the YAML frontmatter has `exclude-newer: "YYYY-MM-DD"`, CRAN is
     resolved from the Posit Package Manager snapshot for that date:
     `https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/YYYY-MM-DD`.
   - The resolved set is hashed (together with the R version and platform) into
     a content-addressed library path under the cache directory.
   - **renv** (`renv::use`) installs the packages into renv's package cache and
     materialises that path as a light-weight library of **symlinks** into the
     cache. The library lives in our cache, not R's temp dir, so it persists.
2. **Run**.
   - Script files run as `Rscript [Rscript-options...] script.R`, so they see
     the user's normal R environment unless forwarded Rscript options such as
     `--vanilla` disable startup files.
   - Inline expressions run as `Rscript -e <expr>`.
   - The materialised library is injected via `R_LIBS`, which **prepends** it to
     `.libPaths()`: the resolved dependencies take precedence, while the user's
     other libraries remain available as a fallback. With `--isolated`, the user
     library is dropped (`R_LIBS_USER=NULL`); the system library stays on the
     path. See [Isolated runs](#isolated-runs).
   - Package executables use their shebang to choose Rscript or Rapp execution.
     `R_LIBS` points to the resolved library, `R_LIBS_USER` is set to `NULL`,
     and `PATH` is prepended with the resolved package `exec/` directories plus
     the directory that contains `IR_RSCRIPT` when it is an explicit path.
   - Installed tool launchers use the same Rscript/Rapp dispatch, but keep the
     resolved library path in the launcher so the tool can be run directly from
     `PATH`.

Libraries are content-addressed: two scripts that resolve to the same set of
package versions share one materialised library, and the individual packages
are shared system-wide through renv's cache.

## Quarto documents

`ir run` also renders Quarto documents (`.qmd`, `.Rmd`). Declare dependencies
under an `ir:` key in the document's YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "My report"
ir:
  dependencies:
    - dplyr>=1.0
    - gt@1.0
  r-version: ">= 4.0"
  exclude-newer: "2024-01-15"
---
```

The `ir:` key accepts the same fields as a script's frontmatter: `dependencies`,
`r-version`, and `exclude-newer`. `r-version` selects an installed R through rig
(see above), and the document is rendered with that same R.

`ir run report.qmd` resolves those dependencies into the same cached, isolated
library used for scripts, then runs `quarto render report.qmd` with that library
and the selected R. Trailing arguments are passed to `quarto render`
(`ir run report.qmd --to pdf`); leading Rscript options are forwarded to the
knitr engine (`ir run --vanilla report.qmd`).

## Cache management

`ir` exposes cache management commands:

```console
$ ir cache dir
$ ir cache clean
```

`ir cache dir` prints the cache root. `ir cache clean` removes the whole `ir`
cache, including materialised libraries and resolution markers.

## Frontmatter format

The YAML frontmatter is the leading block of lines that start exactly with
`#| ` (after a single optional `#!` shebang line). Rust strips the `#| ` prefix,
parses the YAML, and passes the declared dependency specs to the R resolver on
stdin, one dependency per line. Because the block is parsed as real YAML, two
YAML rules apply:

- The `r-version:` constraint must be **quoted** — `r-version: ">= 4.0"` —
  because a bare value starting with `>` is not valid YAML.
- The `dependencies:` field is a YAML sequence, one package ref per item.

```r
#| dependencies:
#|   - dplyr>=1.0      # lower bound
#|   - tidyr           # latest
#|   - cli==3.6.6      # exact version
#| r-version: ">= 4.0" # optional; selected via rig
#| exclude-newer: "2024-01-15"  # optional; resolve from that PPM snapshot date
```

Supported dependency specs in this prototype:

| Spec         | Meaning                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `pkg`        | latest available                                 |
| `pkg>=1.0`   | at least version 1.0                             |
| `pkg==1.2`   | exactly version 1.2                              |

`pkg>=1.0` and `pkg==1.2` are translated to pak refs before resolution. Other
pak ref forms, such as GitHub refs and URL refs, are passed through unchanged.
Version operators that are not representable as pak refs, including `pkg<=1.2`
and `pkg!=1.2`, are not resolved by `ir`.

## Inline expressions and command-line requirements

`ir run` has flags that mirror and extend Rscript:

- **`-e <expr>`** evaluates an inline R expression *instead of* running a script
  file, just like `Rscript -e`. It can be repeated (`-e ... -e ...`), and any
  trailing arguments are passed to the program as `commandArgs(TRUE)`. An inline
  expression has no frontmatter, so it runs against an empty isolated library
  unless dependencies are supplied with `--with`.

- **`ir tool run --from <pkg-ref> <command>`** resolves a package ref and runs
  the command from that package's `exec/` directory. A bare self-named package
  ref such as `ir tool run btw` is treated as `ir tool run --from btw btw`.

- **`ir tool install <pkg-ref>`** resolves a package ref and installs launchers
  for every supported `Rscript` or `Rapp` executable in that package's `exec/`
  directory. Remote refs work directly, for example `ir tool install
  github::r-lib/Rapp`.

- **`--with <pkg>`** adds a dependency for this run. It can be repeated and
  accepts a comma-separated list (`--with dplyr,tidyr`), and uses the same spec
  format as the `dependencies:` frontmatter (e.g. `cli`, `dplyr>=1.0`,
  `cli==3.6.6`). With a script file, `--with` packages are *merged* with the
  script's declared dependencies; with `-e`, they are the only dependencies.
  With `ir tool run`, they are resolved alongside the provider package.

- **`--r-version <spec>`** selects the R version for this run with rig. With a
  script file, it overrides `r-version:` in the frontmatter; with `-e` or
  `ir tool run`, it is the only R version requirement.

```console
$ ir run --with cli -e 'cli::cli_alert_success("works")'
$ ir run --with 'dplyr>=1.1' --with tidyr -e 'library(dplyr); library(tidyr); 1'
$ ir tool run --with cli --from btw btw
$ ir tool run --from 'btw>=0.1.0' btw
$ ir tool install --with cli btw
$ ir run --r-version 4.5 -e 'getRversion()'
$ ir run --vanilla --with cli script.R       # Rscript options still apply
```

`--with` packages, `ir tool run` provider packages, and `--r-version` join the
resolved set that is hashed into the content-addressed library, so a given
combination of frontmatter and command-line requirements resolves once and is
reused on later runs.

## Isolated runs

By default the resolved library is *prepended* to `.libPaths()`, so the user's
own libraries stay on the search path as a fallback. Pass `--isolated` to drop
the user library for the run:

```console
$ ir run --isolated script.R
$ ir run --isolated --with cli -e 'cli::cli_alert_success("hi")'
$ ir tool run btw
```

`--isolated` sets `R_LIBS_USER=NULL` — R's documented way to disable the user
library — so `.libPaths()` is the resolved library plus the site and base/system
libraries. Tool runs always set `R_LIBS_USER=NULL`. This stops a run from
silently borrowing an undeclared package from your personal library. The system
library stays on the path, so base and recommended packages keep working (and
anything else installed there is still visible).

## Requirements

- A Rust toolchain (to build `ir`).
- `R` / `Rscript` on `PATH` when `r-version` is not set.
- `rig` on `PATH` when `r-version` is set.
- The R packages `pak`, `renv`, and `secretbase` installed in that R.

## Build & install

```console
$ cargo build --release
$ cp target/release/ir ~/.local/bin/   # or anywhere on PATH
```

## Testing

```console
$ cargo test
```

`cargo test` runs the Rust CLI tests (`tests/cli.rs`) and, when an R toolchain
with the required test packages is available, the R resolution suite
(`tests/test-resolve.R`) — which covers pak ref normalisation, unsupported
version-operator pass-through, exotic-ref pass-through, snapshot repository
selection, cache keys, and `exclude-newer` handling. The R suite can also be
run on its own:

```console
$ Rscript -e 'testthat::test_file("tests/test-resolve.R", stop_on_failure = TRUE)'
```

## Configuration

| Variable       | Default                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `IR_CACHE_DIR` | `tools::R_user_dir("ir", "cache")`               |
| `IR_RSCRIPT`   | path to the Rscript executable when `r-version` is not set (default: Rscript on PATH) |

The default cache directory follows R's per-package convention (e.g.
`~/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/ir` on macOS), and also honours R's own
`R_USER_CACHE_DIR`.

## Limitations (prototype)

- `r-version` selects installed rig-managed R versions. `ir` does not install
  missing R versions; it reports the `rig install` command to run.
- Dependency specs support bare names, `>=`, `==`, and pak package refs.
  Upper-bound syntax such as `pkg<=1.2` is not resolved by `ir`.
- Repositories default to CRAN (`https://cran.r-project.org`).
- The self-named package executable shortcut is for package refs whose package
  name can be inferred locally, such as `btw` or `btw>=0.1.0`. Use
  `ir tool run --from <pkg-ref> <command>` for remotes and other refs.
