# ir

A [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)-style front-end to R. Write a self-contained
R script that declares its own dependencies in a comment header, and `ir` will
resolve them, build an isolated package library, and run the script against it.

```r
#!/usr/bin/env -S ir run
# dependencies:
#   dplyr>=1.0
#   tidyr
# R: ">= 4.0"

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

1 + 1
```

```console
$ ir run script.R
# or, if the script is executable:
$ ./script.R
```

## How it works

`ir run script.R` runs in two phases:

1. **Resolve + materialise** (a private, throw-away R session).
   - The YAML frontmatter is parsed with the **yaml12** package.
   - The declared dependencies are resolved into concrete package versions
     with **pak** (`pak::pkg_deps`), including the full transitive closure.
   - The resolved set is hashed (together with the R version and platform) into
     a content-addressed library path under the cache directory.
   - **renv** (`renv::use`) installs the packages into renv's package cache and
     materialises that path as a light-weight library of **symlinks** into the
     cache. The library lives in our cache, not R's temp dir, so it persists.
2. **Run** (a fresh, isolated R session).
   - The script runs under `Rscript --vanilla` with `R_LIBS_USER` and
     `R_LIBS_SITE` pointed at the materialised library, so `.libPaths()` is
     exactly `[that library, base R]` — nothing leaks in from the user's
     personal or site libraries.

Libraries are content-addressed: two scripts that resolve to the same set of
package versions share one materialised library, and the individual packages
are shared system-wide through renv's cache.

## Frontmatter format

The header is a block of leading `#` comments parsed as YAML (after a single
optional `#!` shebang line). Because it is parsed as real YAML by the `yaml12`
package, two YAML rules apply:

- The `R:` constraint must be **quoted** — `R: ">= 4.0"` — because a bare value
  starting with `>` is not valid YAML.
- Either list style works for `dependencies`: one entry per indented line, or
  explicit YAML list items with `-`. (Entries are split on whitespace, and
  package refs never contain spaces.)

```r
# dependencies:
#   dplyr>=1.0        # lower bound
#   tidyr             # latest
#   cli==3.6.6        # exact version
# R: ">= 4.0"         # optional; soft-checked against the running R
```

Supported dependency specs in this prototype:

| Spec         | Meaning                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `pkg`        | latest available                                 |
| `pkg>=1.0`   | at least version 1.0                             |
| `pkg<=1.2`   | newest version that is at most 1.2               |
| `pkg<1.2`    | newest version below 1.2                         |
| `pkg>1.2`    | newest version above 1.2                         |
| `pkg==1.2`   | exactly version 1.2                              |

Specs match versions numerically, like pip/uv: `pkg==1.2` selects the published
version *equal to* 1.2 (i.e. `1.2.0`), not the `1.2.x` series. Write operators
without spaces (`pkg<=1.2`, not `pkg <= 1.2`).

`>=` is passed to pak's solver natively. The other operators have no equivalent
in pak's ref syntax, so `ir` resolves them against the package's published
versions (`pak::pkg_history`, including the CRAN archive) and pins the newest
version that satisfies the constraint. If none qualifies, `ir` reports the
available versions.

## Requirements

- A Rust toolchain (to build `ir`).
- `R` / `Rscript` on `PATH` (this prototype uses whatever R it finds).
- The R packages `yaml12`, `pak`, `renv`, and `secretbase` installed in that R.

## Build & install

```console
$ cargo build --release
$ cp target/release/ir ~/.local/bin/   # or anywhere on PATH
```

## Testing

```console
$ cargo test
```

`cargo test` runs the Rust CLI tests (`tests/cli.rs`) and, when an R toolchain
with `testthat` and `yaml12` is available, the R resolution suite
(`tests/test-resolve.R`) — which covers every version operator, numeric version
ordering, exotic-ref pass-through, frontmatter parsing, and error cases against
a mocked version history (offline and deterministic). The R suite can also be
run on its own:

```console
$ Rscript -e 'testthat::test_file("tests/test-resolve.R", stop_on_failure = TRUE)'
```

## Configuration

| Variable        | Default                                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `IR_CACHE_DIR`  | `~/Library/Caches/ir` (macOS), `~/.cache/ir` (Linux) |
| `IR_RSCRIPT`    | `Rscript` (resolved via `PATH`)                      |

## Limitations (prototype)

- Uses the `R`/`Rscript` already on `PATH`; the `R:` constraint is only a soft
  warning, not a version selector.
- Dependency specs support bare names and the `>=`, `<=`, `<`, `>`, `==`
  operators. Other pak ref forms (e.g. `user/repo` GitHub refs) are passed
  through untouched but untested.
- Repositories default to CRAN (`https://cran.r-project.org`).
