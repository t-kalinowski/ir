# ir

`ir` runs standalone R scripts that declare their own runtime requirements in
the script itself. It resolves those requirements into cached, isolated package
libraries and runs the script against them.

```r
#!/usr/bin/env -S ir run
#| dependencies:
#|   - dplyr>=1.0
#|   - tidyr
#| r-version: ">= 4.0"
#| exclude-newer: "2024-01-15"

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

1 + 1
```

```console
$ ir run script.R
$ ir run --vanilla script.R
# or, if the script is executable:
$ ./script.R
```

It can also evaluate inline expressions, pull in extra dependencies from the
command line, and run package-shipped executables from `exec/`:

```console
$ ir run -e '1 + 1'                          # inline expression, isolated library
$ ir run --with cli -e 'cli::cli_alert_success("hi")'
$ ir run --with dplyr,tidyr script.R         # add to the script's own deps
$ ir run --r-version 4.5 script.R            # select R with rig
$ ir run --from btw btw --help               # run exec/btw from package btw
$ ir run btw --help                          # shorthand for --from btw btw
$ ir run --from github::r-lib/Rapp Rapp
```

For `--from pkg tool`, `ir` resolves `pkg`, finds `exec/tool` or `exec/tool.R`
in the installed package, and launches that file through its shebang. The
package ref can be a pak package ref or supported version spec. Use quotes when
the shell would otherwise interpret characters such as `>`.

## How it works

`ir run` runs in two phases:

1. **Resolve + materialise** (a private, throw-away R session).
   - The YAML frontmatter is parsed by Rust with **saphyr**.
   - A *resolution cache* short-circuits this whole phase: the declared
     dependencies plus the resolution source (and R version / platform) are
     hashed, and if that exact request was already resolved, its library is
     reused and **pak is not invoked at all**. Latest resolution folds the
     current date into the key, forcing a fresh resolution — picking up newly
     published versions — at most once a day. Dated Posit Package Manager
     snapshot resolution uses the snapshot date instead.
   - On a cache miss, the declared dependencies are resolved into concrete
     package versions with **pak** (`pak::pkg_deps`), including the full
     transitive closure.
   - If the YAML frontmatter has `exclude-newer: "YYYY-MM-DD"`, CRAN is
     resolved from the Posit Package Manager snapshot for that date:
     `https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/YYYY-MM-DD`.
   - If the YAML frontmatter has `r-version: "VERSION-SPEC"` or `ir run` is
     called with `--r-version VERSION-SPEC`, the requested R version is selected
     from installed versions reported by `rig list --json`. If no installed R
     satisfies the request, `ir` consults `rig available --json` to suggest a
     concrete `rig install` command. If `exclude-newer` is present, that install
     suggestion ignores R versions released after the date.
   - The resolved set is hashed (together with the R version and platform) into
     a content-addressed library path under the cache directory.
   - **renv** (`renv::use`) installs the packages into renv's package cache and
     materialises that path as a light-weight library of **symlinks** into the
     cache. The library lives in our cache, not R's temp dir, so it persists.
2. **Run**.
   - Script files run as `Rscript [Rscript-options...] script.R`, so they see
     the user's normal R environment unless forwarded Rscript options such as
     `--vanilla` disable startup files.
   - Inline expressions run as `Rscript -e <expr>`.
   - The materialised library is injected via `R_LIBS`, which **prepends** it to
     `.libPaths()`: the resolved dependencies take precedence, while the user's
     other libraries remain available as a fallback. With `--isolated`, the user
     library is dropped (`R_LIBS_USER=NULL`); the system library stays on the
     path. See [Isolated runs](#isolated-runs).
   - Package executables run directly through their shebang. `R_LIBS` points to
     the resolved library, and `PATH` is prepended with the resolved package
     `exec/` directories plus the directory that contains `IR_RSCRIPT` when it
     is an explicit path. This lets `#!/usr/bin/env Rapp` find a resolved Rapp
     executable and `#!/usr/bin/env Rscript` find the selected Rscript.

Libraries are content-addressed: two scripts that resolve to the same set of
package versions share one materialised library, and the individual packages
are shared system-wide through renv's cache.

## Cache management

`ir` exposes cache management commands:

```console
$ ir cache dir
$ ir cache clean
```

`ir cache dir` prints the cache root. `ir cache clean` removes the whole `ir`
cache, including materialised libraries and resolution markers.

## Frontmatter format

The YAML frontmatter is the leading block of lines that start exactly with
`#| ` (after a single optional `#!` shebang line). Rust strips the `#| ` prefix,
parses the YAML, and passes the declared dependency specs to the R resolver on
stdin, one dependency per line. Because the block is parsed as real YAML, two
YAML rules apply:

- The `r-version:` constraint must be **quoted** — `r-version: ">= 4.0"` —
  because a bare value starting with `>` is not valid YAML.
- The `dependencies:` field is a YAML sequence, one package ref per item.

```r
#| dependencies:
#|   - dplyr>=1.0      # lower bound
#|   - tidyr           # latest
#|   - cli==3.6.6      # exact version
#| r-version: ">= 4.0" # optional; selected via rig
#| exclude-newer: "2024-01-15"  # optional; resolve from that PPM snapshot date
```

Supported dependency specs in this prototype:

| Spec         | Meaning                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `pkg`        | latest available                                 |
| `pkg>=1.0`   | at least version 1.0                             |
| `pkg==1.2`   | exactly version 1.2                              |

`pkg>=1.0` and `pkg==1.2` are translated to pak refs before resolution. Other
pak ref forms, such as GitHub refs and URL refs, are passed through unchanged.
Version operators that are not representable as pak refs, including `pkg<=1.2`
and `pkg!=1.2`, are not resolved by `ir`.

## Inline expressions and command-line requirements

`ir run` has flags that mirror and extend Rscript:

- **`-e <expr>`** evaluates an inline R expression *instead of* running a script
  file, just like `Rscript -e`. It can be repeated (`-e ... -e ...`), and any
  trailing arguments are passed to the program as `commandArgs(TRUE)`. An inline
  expression has no frontmatter, so it runs against an empty isolated library
  unless dependencies are supplied with `--with`.

- **`--from <pkg-ref>`** resolves a package ref and runs the following command
  from that package's `exec/` directory. A bare self-named package ref such as
  `btw` is treated as `--from btw btw` when it is not an existing path.

- **`--with <pkg>`** adds a dependency for this run. It can be repeated and
  accepts a comma-separated list (`--with dplyr,tidyr`), and uses the same spec
  format as the `dependencies:` frontmatter (e.g. `cli`, `dplyr>=1.0`,
  `cli==3.6.6`). With a script file, `--with` packages are *merged* with the
  script's declared dependencies; with `-e`, they are the only dependencies.
  With `--from`, they are resolved alongside the provider package.

- **`--r-version <spec>`** selects the R version for this run with rig. With a
  script file, it overrides `r-version:` in the frontmatter; with `-e` or
  `--from`, it is the only R version requirement.

```console
$ ir run --with cli -e 'cli::cli_alert_success("works")'
$ ir run --with 'dplyr>=1.1' --with tidyr -e 'library(dplyr); library(tidyr); 1'
$ ir run --with cli --from btw btw
$ ir run --from 'btw>=0.1.0' btw
$ ir run --r-version 4.5 -e 'getRversion()'
$ ir run --vanilla --with cli script.R       # Rscript options still apply
```

`--with` packages, `--from` provider packages, and `--r-version` join the
resolved set that is hashed into the content-addressed library, so a given
combination of frontmatter and command-line requirements resolves once and is
reused on later runs.

## Isolated runs

By default the resolved library is *prepended* to `.libPaths()`, so the user's
own libraries stay on the search path as a fallback. Pass `--isolated` to drop
the user library for the run:

```console
$ ir run --isolated script.R
$ ir run --isolated --with cli -e 'cli::cli_alert_success("hi")'
$ ir run --isolated --from btw btw
```

`--isolated` sets `R_LIBS_USER=NULL` — R's documented way to disable the user
library — so `.libPaths()` is the resolved library plus the site and base/system
libraries. This stops a run from silently borrowing an undeclared package from
your personal library. The system library stays on the path, so base and
recommended packages keep working (and anything else installed there is still
visible).

## Requirements

- A Rust toolchain (to build `ir`).
- `R` / `Rscript` on `PATH` when `r-version` is not set.
- `rig` on `PATH` when `r-version` is set.
- The R packages `pak`, `renv`, and `secretbase` installed in that R.

## Build & install

```console
$ cargo build --release
$ cp target/release/ir ~/.local/bin/   # or anywhere on PATH
```

## Testing

```console
$ cargo test
```

`cargo test` runs the Rust CLI tests (`tests/cli.rs`) and, when an R toolchain
with the required test packages is available, the R resolution suite
(`tests/test-resolve.R`) — which covers pak ref normalisation, unsupported
version-operator pass-through, exotic-ref pass-through, snapshot repository
selection, cache keys, and `exclude-newer` handling. The R suite can also be
run on its own:

```console
$ Rscript -e 'testthat::test_file("tests/test-resolve.R", stop_on_failure = TRUE)'
```

## Configuration

| Variable       | Default                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `IR_CACHE_DIR` | `tools::R_user_dir("ir", "cache")`               |
| `IR_RSCRIPT`   | `Rscript` (resolved via `PATH`)                  |

The default cache directory follows R's per-package convention (e.g.
`~/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/ir` on macOS), and also honours R's own
`R_USER_CACHE_DIR`.

## Limitations (prototype)

- Dependency specs support bare names, `>=`, `==`, and pak package refs.
  Upper-bound syntax such as `pkg<=1.2` is not resolved by `ir`.
- Repositories default to CRAN (`https://cran.r-project.org`).
- The self-named package executable shortcut is for package refs whose package
  name can be inferred locally, such as `btw` or `btw>=0.1.0`. Use
  `--from <pkg-ref> <command>` for remotes and other refs.
