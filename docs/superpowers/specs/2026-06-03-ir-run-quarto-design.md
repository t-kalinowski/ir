# Design: `ir run` for Quarto documents

**Date:** 2026-06-03
**Status:** Approved, pending implementation plan

## Goal

Extend `ir run` so it renders standalone Quarto documents the same way it runs
standalone R scripts today: `ir run doc.qmd` resolves the document's declared
dependencies into a cached, isolated package library and runs `quarto render`
against that library and the selected R.

Dependencies are declared in the document's YAML frontmatter under an `ir:`
key, reusing the resolver's existing vocabulary:

```yaml
---
ir:
  dependencies:
    - dplyr>=1.0
    - gt@1.0
  R: ">= 4.6"
  exclude after: "2024-01-15"
---
```

## Background: how `ir run script.R` works today

Two phases (see `README.md`):

1. **Resolve + materialise** (private R session). Rust extracts the frontmatter,
   the dependencies are resolved with pak into concrete versions, hashed into a
   content-addressed library path under the cache dir, and materialised as a
   light-weight library of symlinks into renv's cache.
2. **Run** (ordinary R session). The script runs as `Rscript script.R` with
   `R_LIBS` set to the materialised library, which prepends it to `.libPaths()`.

The R binary `ir` uses is "the selected Rscript" — today `IR_RSCRIPT` or
`Rscript` on PATH. R-version *selection* is not implemented; `R:` is only a
soft check inside the resolver.

### Built on PR #14 (merged)

This design assumes the architecture of PR #14 (`t-kalinowski/ir`), merged into
`main` as `14e688f`, which moved YAML parsing from R into Rust:

- Rust parses the frontmatter with `saphyr` into
  `ScriptSpec { dependencies, exclude_after, r_requirement }`
  (`parse_frontmatter`, helpers `frontmatter_dependencies` /
  `frontmatter_optional_string`).
- `resolve.R` no longer parses YAML. It receives dependency specs on **stdin**
  (one per line) plus `IR_EXCLUDE_AFTER`, `IR_R_REQUIREMENT`, and
  `IR_RESOLVE_RESULT_FILE` environment variables.
- Version-operator translation (`dplyr>=1.0` → pak ref) stays in `resolve.R`,
  fed from those stdin lines.

Because of #14, the qmd flow produces the **identical** stdin + env inputs that
a script produces. `resolve.R` is untouched by this work.

## How Quarto consumes the selected R and library

Verified against quarto-cli source (`src/core/resources.ts`, `src/execute/rmd.ts`)
and triangulated with deepwiki and quarto-web docs:

- **R binary selection** (`resources.ts:100-164`): resolution order is
  `QUARTO_R` → `R_HOME` → PATH → Windows registry → Program Files. Setting
  `QUARTO_R` pins the R quarto's knitr engine uses. It accepts either an
  `Rscript` file path or its `bin` directory.
- **Library path** (`rmd.ts:440`): quarto spawns `Rscript` via `execProcess`,
  inheriting the parent environment. `R_LIBS` set in `ir`'s process passes
  through to that R subprocess and prepends `.libPaths()` — the same mechanism
  `ir run script.R` already uses. No quarto-specific library configuration is
  needed.

**Invariant:** `QUARTO_R` must be the exact Rscript `ir` resolved/materialised
the library against. The library is content-addressed by resolved versions + R
version + platform; using a different R for rendering would not match it.

## Architecture

Rust-only changes. **Zero changes to `resolve.R`.** Phase 1 (resolve +
materialise) is unchanged. Phase 2 dispatches by file extension.

### Components

1. **`ScriptSpec` model — reused unchanged.** The qmd `ir:` block maps to the
   same three fields (`dependencies`, `exclude_after` from `exclude after`,
   `r_requirement` from `R`).

2. **Frontmatter source, dispatched by extension.** Keep
   `read_op_frontmatter_to_string` (the `#| ` line reader) for `.R`. Add a
   reader that captures the leading `---` … `---` YAML block for `.qmd` / `.Rmd`.
   The reader is chosen by the script's extension (case-insensitive).

3. **`parse_frontmatter` gains a nested path.** For qmd, the spec mapping node
   is `doc["ir"]` rather than the top-level document. Since
   `frontmatter_dependencies` and `frontmatter_optional_string` already accept a
   `&Yaml` node, they are handed the `ir:` sub-node. An absent or null `ir:`
   key yields `ScriptSpec::default()` (no dependencies). All other quarto keys
   (`title`, `format`, …) are ignored for free.

4. **Phase-2 dispatch in `cmd_run`.** By extension (case-insensitive): a `.qmd`
   or `.Rmd` target routes to the new `run_quarto`; **every other name —
   including `.R`, `.r`, and extensionless scripts — keeps the existing
   `run_script` flow.** Routing only the two Quarto extensions away, rather than
   erroring on anything non-`.R`, preserves the common shebang case
   (`#!/usr/bin/env -S ir run` executed as a bare, often extensionless, file
   name). Phase 1 (`resolve_library`) runs identically for both.

5. **`run_quarto`.** Select the quarto executable via `quarto_command()` —
   `IR_QUARTO` if set, else bare `quarto` resolved on PATH (mirrors
   `IR_RSCRIPT`/`rscript_command`). Build `quarto render <doc> <script_args>`.
   Environment:
   - **`QUARTO_R`** — set to the selected Rscript **only when it is path-like**
     (an existing path, or a value containing a path separator). For the bare
     `Rscript` default, `QUARTO_R` is left unset so quarto resolves `Rscript` on
     PATH — the same binary `ir` used — which avoids quarto's "Specified
     `QUARTO_R` … does not exist" warning while preserving the same-R invariant.
   - **`R_LIBS`** — set to the materialised library only when dependencies were
     resolved (the only env var conditional on dependency resolution; `QUARTO_R`
     and `QUARTO_KNITR_RSCRIPT_ARGS` are conditional on path-likeness and on
     having any `rscript_args`, respectively).
   - **`QUARTO_KNITR_RSCRIPT_ARGS`** — set to the comma-joined `rscript_args`
     when any are present, so quarto's knitr Rscript receives them.

   Use the same platform split as `run_script` (exec on Unix, spawn + status on
   Windows). Propagate the exit code. A missing `quarto` surfaces as a clear
   error from this function (see edge cases).

### Selected-Rscript seam

`ir` already has one notion of "the Rscript to run against" (today `IR_RSCRIPT`
or PATH `Rscript`; future: a colleague's rig integration). It feeds: phase-1
resolve, the `.R` run (`R_LIBS` + exec), and the qmd run (becomes `QUARTO_R`).
Keeping a single source enforces the invariant above. R-version *selection*
itself is out of scope — this work only plumbs the chosen Rscript to `QUARTO_R`.

### Quarto-executable seam

The quarto binary is selected the same way: `IR_QUARTO` if set, else bare
`quarto` on PATH (`quarto_command()`, mirroring `rscript_command()`). The bare
default covers an installed quarto. On **Windows**, Rust's bare-name PATH search
resolves only `quarto.exe` (it does not consult `PATHEXT`), so a dev build
shipped as `quarto.cmd` is unreachable by bare name — `IR_QUARTO` set to that
file's full path selects it (an explicit `.cmd` runs via Rust's cmd.exe
wrapping). This also lets tests fake quarto without touching PATH.

## Data flow (qmd)

```
doc.qmd
  → extract leading `---` … `---` block (Rust)
  → parse_frontmatter, descend into `ir:` → ScriptSpec
  → deps on stdin + IR_EXCLUDE_AFTER + IR_R_REQUIREMENT → resolve.R
  → resolve + materialise content-addressed library → library path
  → run_quarto: QUARTO_R=<rscript> (only if path-like),
                R_LIBS=<library> (only if deps resolved),
                QUARTO_KNITR_RSCRIPT_ARGS=<rscript_args> (if any)
  → quarto render doc.qmd <script_args>
  → quarto knitr spawns QUARTO_R Rscript, inherits R_LIBS
  → .libPaths() prepended → document renders
```

## Error handling and edge cases

- **No `ir:` key / no dependencies** → `R_LIBS` is not set; quarto renders
  against the **ambient library paths**. `QUARTO_R` is still pinned per the rule
  above, so the R *binary* selection is unchanged — only the library set differs.
  Parallels a no-dependency script.
- **`quarto` not found** → clear error from `run_quarto` ("could not find
  `quarto` … or set IR_QUARTO …"). No preflight check: a missing `quarto` is
  reported at the render step, after phase 1. The tradeoff is that on a resolution
  cache-miss the resolver runs before the failure; cache hits resolve instantly,
  so the wasted work is normally negligible, and the happy path is not burdened
  with an extra `quarto --version` spawn (~1s of Deno startup) on every run.
- **qmd frontmatter shape** → the `---` block reader recognises the leading YAML
  metadata block: an opening `---` on the first line (after an optional UTF-8
  BOM), terminated by a line that is exactly `---` or `...`. It is CRLF-tolerant
  (Windows line endings). A file with no opening fence, an empty block, or no
  `ir:` key yields `ScriptSpec::default()` (no dependencies) — never an error.
  Malformed YAML *inside* a present block errors the same way a script does.
- **`QUARTO_R` paths with spaces** → `QUARTO_R` is passed as an environment
  variable, not a command-line argument, so there is no shell parsing and paths
  containing spaces need no quoting.
- **Document inside an renv-activated project** → the document's `.Rprofile`
  can re-set `.libPaths()` and shadow `R_LIBS`. Known limitation; `ir` targets
  *standalone* documents, the same standalone assumption made for scripts.
  Documented, not solved here.

## Passthrough arguments

`ir run` takes two argument buckets (`parse_run_args`): leading `-`-prefixed
tokens are `rscript_args`, the first bare token is the document, trailing tokens
are `script_args`. The qmd flow maps each to the equivalent quarto target,
preserving the #13 intent that leading options target the R running the code:

- **`script_args` → `quarto render <doc> <script_args>`.** E.g.
  `ir run doc.qmd --to pdf` → `quarto render doc.qmd --to pdf`.
- **`rscript_args` → `QUARTO_KNITR_RSCRIPT_ARGS`** (comma-joined). E.g.
  `ir run --vanilla doc.qmd` sets `QUARTO_KNITR_RSCRIPT_ARGS=--vanilla`, which
  quarto splits on commas and passes to its knitr Rscript (`rmd.ts:434`).
  Quarto's split (`rmd.ts:435`) is a bare `","` split with **no escape
  mechanism**, so a token containing a comma cannot be transported faithfully.
  Rather than mis-split silently, `run_quarto` **rejects any `rscript_arg`
  containing a comma** with a clear error before launching quarto.

## Testing

- **Unit:** `---`-block frontmatter extraction (opening/closing fences, `...`
  terminator, CRLF, optional BOM, no-fence → empty); `parse_frontmatter` descent
  into `ir:` (present, absent, null, non-mapping); comma-rejection of
  `rscript_args`.
- **Integration** (fake executables, as in `tests/cli.rs`): a `.qmd` resolves
  via the fake Rscript (`IR_RSCRIPT`) then invokes a fake quarto selected via
  `IR_QUARTO`, asserting the `quarto render <doc>` argv, `QUARTO_R` set/unset per
  the path-like rule, `R_LIBS`, and `QUARTO_KNITR_RSCRIPT_ARGS`. A `.Rmd` target
  is asserted to route to quarto too. A non-`.R`/non-qmd or extensionless script
  still takes the R-script path. Because `IR_QUARTO` takes a full path, no PATH
  manipulation is needed; a Windows variant uses a `.cmd` fake to cover the
  spawn-and-propagate-exit-code path.
- **Docs/snapshots:** updating `ir run` help text to mention Quarto documents
  requires updating the `tests/snapshots/*.stdout` files added by #17 and the
  `contains(...)` assertions in `tests/cli.rs`, since help is snapshot-tested by
  exact match.

## Out of scope

- R-version *selection* (separate rig integration; this work only carries the
  selected Rscript to `QUARTO_R`).
- Quarto verbs other than `render` (e.g. `preview`).
- Jupyter / `.ipynb` documents (Python engine).

## Dev workflow / sequencing

- Base the implementation branch on `origin/main` at `4f23532` (latest as of
  writing): #14 (Rust YAML parsing), #13 (`rscript_args`/`script_args` split),
  and #17 (help snapshot tests) are all merged and assumed present.
- #17 makes `ir run` help snapshot-tested by exact match; any help-text change
  must update `tests/snapshots/*.stdout` in the same commit.
- Single remote `origin` is `t-kalinowski/ir` (no fork). Push the branch to
  `origin`, open a PR against `main`, and link the work to the tracking issue.

## Rejected alternative

Parse the `---` block and extract the `ir:` subtree, but keep YAML descent in
R. Rejected: after #14 there is no YAML parser left in `resolve.R`. Re-adding
one to descend into `ir:` would duplicate parsing and diverge from #14's
direction. Rust-side descent reuses #14's helpers and leaves `resolve.R`
untouched.

## Naming note

`ScriptSpec` / `read_script_spec` read awkwardly once documents are involved.
Recommendation: keep #14's names to match the merged conventions and minimise
diff. A `RunSpec` rename is optional churn that can be skipped.
